# Analytics Engineering Project: Summer and Winter Olympics Analysis with dbt

## Overview

This repository contains an Analytics Engineering project that focuses on analyzing data from the Summer and Winter Olympics using the dbt (data build tool) framework. The project is structured with three layers: raw data, staging, and reporting. It also includes dbt models and tests to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Background

This project aims to explore and analyze data related to the Summer and Winter Olympics. By utilizing the dbt framework, we've organized the data processing pipeline into distinct stages, enabling better data transformation, analysis, and reporting. The project leverages dbt's modeling capabilities to provide meaningful insights from the raw Olympic data.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awittek/AnalyticsEngineeringProject.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for any specific package versions:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your dbt profiles as described in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile).

## Usage

1. **Data Setup**: Place your raw Olympic data in the appropriate directory.

2. **Modeling**: Utilize dbt models to build meaningful datasets for analysis:

   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```

3. **Testing**: Ensure data quality and consistency by running tests:

   ```bash
   dbt test
   ```

4. **Reporting**: Generate reports and insights from the dbt models.

## Project Structure

The project follows the following directory structure:

- `data/`: Raw data files for Summer and Winter Olympics.
- `models/`: dbt models for data transformation and analysis.
- `tests/`: dbt tests for ensuring data quality.
- `macros/`: Reusable SQL macros for dbt models.

## Models

The dbt models are defined to transform raw Olympic data into structured datasets. These models are located in the `models/` directory and are organized by their respective layers - RAW, STAGING, REPORTING.

## Tests

Tests are defined in the `tests/` directory to verify the quality of the transformed data. These tests ensure that the data remains accurate and consistent throughout the transformation process.
